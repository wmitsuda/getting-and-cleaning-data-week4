# Introduction

This repository contains my submission for Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data course, week 4 assignment.

The root directory contains a run_analysis.R file which can be run to generate:

* A summarized-data.txt file containing the tidy data set produced for the step 5 of the instructions which was also submitted in the part 1 of the assignment.
* It will also print the resulting data set as a result of the script execution, but due to the large number of rows and columns, the output will be cut. The resulting data set will also be assigned to the "summary" variable, which can be examined by a View(summary) command inside RStudio, for example.

The codebook is contained in the CodeBook.md file.
